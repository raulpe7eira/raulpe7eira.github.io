I'm full-stack software developer with +18 years of professional experience, currently I integrate [the passionate team of Jaya](https://jaya.tech/ "link to Jaya website"), focused on the Java, Kotlin, Elixir and JavaScript ecosystems.

All my professional experience is based on my graduation in 2001 at the extinct UniverCidade and postgraduate courses of *"Analysis, Design and Management Systems"* and *"Ergonomics, Usability and HCI: Ergodesign and Interfaces Assessment"* at [Puc-Rio](http://www.puc-rio.br "lint to PUC-Rio website").

One of the best parts of my profession is that you are continually specializing and seeking ways to improve and break challenges in various areas of human knowledge.

When I'm not working, you can find me taking care of my family, [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/raulpe7eira "link to Strava profile"), [watching a movie](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur28106453 "link to IMDb profile"), [listening to rock](https://www.last.fm/user/raulpereira "link to last.fm profile") or podcast, reading a comic book or a book, be it technology or just a children's book for my babies.

I also [push code](https://github.com/raulpe7eira "link to GitHub profile") quite often, and [show off pictures](https://instagram.com/raulpe7eira "link to Instagram profile") from time to time.
